abstract="In this chapter methods of handling missing attribute values in Data Mining are described. These methods are categorized into sequential and parallel. In sequential methods, missing attribute values are replaced by known values first, as a preprocessing, then the knowledge is acquired for a data set with all known attribute values. In parallel methods, there is no preprocessing, i.e., knowledge is acquired directly from the original data sets. In this chapter the main emphasis is put on rule induction. Methods of handling attribute values for decision tree generation are only briefly summarized.",

We use our particular case study to illustrate such issues as problem formulation, selection of evaluation measures, and data preparation. We relate these issues to properties of the oil spill application, such as its imbalanced class distribution, that are shown to be common to many applications. Our solutions to these issues are implemented in the Canadian Environmental Hazards Detection System (CEHDS), which is about to undergo field testing.",

abstract="Streaming data is pervasive in a multitude of data mining applications. One fundamental problem in the task of mining streaming data is distributional drift over time. Streams may also exhibit high and varying degrees of class imbalance, which can further complicate the task. In scenarios like these, class imbalance is particularly difficult to overcome and has not been as thoroughly studied. In this paper, we comprehensively consider the issues of changing distributions in conjunction with high degrees of class imbalance in streaming data. We propose new approaches based on distributional divergence and meta-classification that improve several performance metrics often applied in the study of imbalanced classification. We also propose a new distance measure for detecting distributional drift and examine its utility in weighting ensemble base classifiers. We employ a sequential validation framework, which we believe is the most meaningful option in the context of streaming imbalanced data.",

abstract="In many data stream applications, the category distribution is imbalanced. However, current research community on data stream mining focus on mining balanced data streams, without enough attention being paid to the study of mining skewed data streams. In this paper, we proposed an clustering-sampling based ensemble algorithm with weighted majority voting for learning skewed data streams. We made experiments on synthetic data set simulating skewed data streams. The experiment results show that clustering-sampling outperforms under-sampling, and that compared with single window, the proposed ensemble based algorithm has better classification performance.",

abstract="The paper presents the research on the computer support system which is able to recognize the type of hypertension. This diagnostic problem is highly imbalanced, because only ca. 5{\%} of patient suffering from hypertension are diagnosed as secondary hypertension. Additionally the secondary hypertension could be caused by several disorders (in our work we recognize the five most popular reasons) which require strikingly different therapies. Thus, appropriate classification methods, which take into consideration the nature of the decision task should be applied to this problem. We decided to employ the original classification methods developed by our team which have their origin in one-class classification and the ensemble learning. They quality was confirmed in our previous works. The accuracy of the chosen classifiers was evaluated on the basis of the computer experiments which were carried out on the real data set obtained from the hypertension clinic. The results of the experimental investigations confirmed usefulness of the proposed, hierarchical one-class classifier ensemble and could be applied in the real medical decision support systems.",

abstract="Many real world data mining applications involve learning from imbalanced data sets. Learning from data sets that contain very few instances of the minority (or interesting) class usually produces biased classifiers that have a higher predictive accuracy over the majority class(es), but poorer predictive accuracy over the minority class. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a novel approach for learning from imbalanced data sets, based on a combination of the SMOTE algorithm and the boosting procedure. Unlike standard boosting where all misclassified examples are given equal weights, SMOTEBoost creates synthetic examples from the rare or minority class, thus indirectly changing the updating weights and compensating for skewed distributions. SMOTEBoost applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets shows improvement in prediction performance on the minority class and overall improved F-values.",
